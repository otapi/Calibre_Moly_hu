[B]Version 1.0.8[/B] - 30 May 2018
Search primarily by isbn. (It's the most specific and accurate data. Try out the Extract ISBN plugin. With that the search is almost flawles)
If no match found fall back to broader search.
If no match try to remove () parts from title, after that try to remove authors.
