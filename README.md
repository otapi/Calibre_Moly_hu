# Calibre_Moly_hu
This [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) plugin has been created to download metadata and cover image from Moly.hu.

Original post from https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=193302 by Kloon:
I must give credits to the original author, Daermond for making and publishing the initial plugin, but sadly he had abandoned it, so here I am taking over and fixing the errors that have popped up since.

Also, a big thumbs up for kiwidude, for sorting things out for me. 
And now an update by another author - fatsadt

## Main features:
Can retrieve title, author, series, ISBN, comments, tags, publisher, year of publication, rating and a cover images
Shows multiple results if possible (3 by default)
Search based on ISBN if present, otherwise based on title and/or author
Downloads multiple cover images if possible (5 by default)

## Special Notes:
Requires Calibre 0.8 or later. Tested with 3.2.0.0

## Installation Notes:
Download the attached zip file and install the plugin as described in the Introduction to plugins thread.
Note that this is not a GUI plugin so it is not intended/cannot be added to context menus/toolbars etc.


## Version History:

**Version 1.0.8** - 30 May 2018
Search primarily by isbn. (It's the most specific and accurate data. Try out the Extract ISBN plugin. With that the search is almost flawles)
If no match found fall back to broader search.
If no match try to remove () parts from title, after that try to remove authors.
